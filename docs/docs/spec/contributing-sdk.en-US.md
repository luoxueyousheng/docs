- **Showcase your work**: Use documentation to demonstrate your SDK's design philosophy and technical implementation
- **Gain recognition**: Your contributions will be recognized and appreciated by the community

## Documentation Structure

### Basic Structure

Each SDK document should include the following basic sections:

1. **Introduction**: An overview of the SDK, its features, and applicable scenarios
2. **Quick Start**: Installation and basic usage examples
3. **API Reference**: Detailed API documentation
4. **Advanced Usage**: Advanced features and usage tips
5. **Sample Code**: Complete usage examples
6. **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions and troubleshooting

### File Organization

The recommended file organization for SDK documentation is as follows:

```
docs/
  your-sdk-name/
    index.md          # Home page
    quickstart.md     # Quick start
    api-reference.md  # API reference
    advanced.md       # Advanced usage
    examples.md       # Sample code
    faq.md            # FAQ
```

## Documentation Writing Guidelines

### Formatting Requirements

- **Use Markdown**: All documentation uses Markdown format
- **Heading levels**: Use appropriate heading levels to keep the structure clear
