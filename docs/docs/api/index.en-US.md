# Core API

Explains how to **start JadeView**, and what each field of the two structs used when creating a window **controls respectively**. Other functions are organized into separate sections on the left.

---

## Lifecycle and Startup

### Initialize the runtime (`JadeView_init`)

**Purpose**: Start the library's internal **GUI thread and event loop**, and register what your application is called, where its data goes, and whether it should be single-instance. After a successful call, you still need to wait for the **`app-ready`** event before creating windows or using the local protocol.

```c
int32_t JadeView_init(
  int32_t enable_devmod,
  const char* log_path,
  const char* data_directory,
  const char* app_name,
  const char* app_signature,
  int32_t single_instance
);
```

| Parameter | Description |
|------|------|
| `enable_devmod` | Whether to enable **development-oriented capabilities** (such as DevTools and debugging shortcuts). For an official release, you generally pass `0`. |
| `log_path` | Which file the log is written to; passing `NULL` means no file is written (whether it prints to the console is up to the implementation). |
| `data_directory` | The data root path; `NULL` or empty uses the system default (such as `%LOCALAPPDATA%`). The directory actually used by WebView will further append a subdirectory related to `app_signature`. |
| `app_name` | The **application display name**, required, used for scenarios such as protocols and notifications. |
| `app_signature` | The **unique application identifier**, required, at least 6 characters, used to generate the data directory name, the single-instance pipe name, and so on; getting it wrong will cause initialization to fail. |
| `single_instance` | When non-`0`: **only one of your processes is allowed on the entire machine**; launching it again will send the command line to the first launched process, and this current `JadeView_init` will return `0`. |

| Return value | Meaning |
|--------|------|
| `1` | The GUI has been started, **but is not yet ready**; you must wait for `app-ready`. |
| `0` | It did not start (parameter error, or it was rejected as a second instance, etc.). |

#### What you receive in `app-ready`

| Situation | `window_id` | Roughly what `event_data` looks like |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Normal startup completed | `1` | Text `success` |
| `app_name` / `app_signature` validation failed | `0` | JSON: `{"ok":false,"code":"...","message":"..."}` |
| GUI thread crashed | `0` | A plain-text error description |

Call `jade_on("app-ready", ...)` **before `JadeView_init`**, otherwise you will miss the first notification.

---

### Run the message loop (`run_message_loop`)

**Purpose**: May be used in the legacy integration approach where "the exe runs the message loop itself". In the common **DLL embedding** scenario, the loop already runs in the thread started by `JadeView_init`, so you **generally do not need to call it**.

```c
int32_t run_message_loop(void);
```

---

### Clean up all windows (`cleanup_all_windows`) ⚠️ Planned for deprecation

:::warning
`cleanup_all_windows` has entered the deprecation plan since 2.2; please use [`jadeview_exit()`](#jadeview_exit) instead.
:::

**Purpose**: Close all JadeView windows, tear down resources, and let the event loop end. Equivalent to the cleanup performed before the application exits.

```c
int32_t cleanup_all_windows(void);
```

| Return value | Meaning |
|--------|------|
| `1` | Shutdown and cleanup have been initiated. |
| `0` | Failed (for example, initialization has not yet completed). |

---

### Exit the application (`jadeview_exit`)

:::warning
Supported starting from v2.2.
:::

**Purpose**: Replaces `cleanup_all_windows`; closes all JadeView windows, tears down resources, and lets the event loop end.

```c
int32_t jadeview_exit(void);
```

| Return value | Meaning |
|--------|------|
| `1` | Shutdown and cleanup have been initiated. |
| `0` | Failed (for example, initialization has not yet completed). |

---

The local protocol service APIs (`set_protocol_service_path`, `register_resource`, `unregister_resource`, `clear_window_resources`) have been moved to the separate document [Local Protocol Service](/en-US/docs/api/local-server-api).

The context menu APIs (`jade_menu_item_create`, etc.) have been moved to the separate document [Context Menu](/en-US/docs/api/context-menu-api).

## Version Changes at a Glance

### Added and enhanced in 2.3

| Symbol / Capability | What it does | Doc |
|------|------------|------|
| `yaml_set_str` / `yaml_get_str` / `yaml_get_all` / `yaml_has` / `yaml_delete` / `yaml_clear` / `yaml_delete_file` / `yaml_keys` / `yaml_len` | The YAML storage interface has been greatly expanded; also adds array index syntax `[N]`, two-phase queries, negative error codes, atomic writes, and file locking. | [YAML Storage API](/en-US/docs/api/yaml-storage-api) |
| `jade_ntp_now` | Obtains a network UTC timestamp via NTP, without relying on the local clock; you can specify a server or use the built-in list with concurrent queries. | [System Integration API](/en-US/docs/api/system-api) |
| `jade-region-drag` / `jade-region-no-drag` | Custom window drag regions based on HTML attributes, not relying on CSS, and right-click does not pop up the system title bar menu. | [Window Interaction Control](/en-US/docs/api/window-styling) |
| `drag-drop` synchronous interception | `enter` / `drop` support synchronous interception/consumption (the callback returns a non-null pointer), while `over` / `leave` remain asynchronous. | [Event Types](/en-US/docs/api/event-types) |
| IPC communication path optimization | `invoke` and broadcast share the same send path, and high-frequency small events are merged before sending; the external interface stays compatible with the old message form. | [IPC Communication API](/en-US/docs/api/ipc-api) |

:::info
`jade_ntp_now` adds a `const char* ntp_server` parameter since 2.3 (ABI change); old calls keep the original behavior by passing `NULL`.
:::

### Added and renamed interfaces in 2.0 (relative to the old version)

| Symbol | What it does |
|------|------------|
| `create_borderless_webview_window` | Creates a WebView window **without a system title bar**. |
| `get_window_hwnd` | Only this kind of window can obtain the **HWND** for use with other Win32 APIs. |
| `set_protocol_service_path` | Mounts a local folder as the built-in protocol root, and the page loads static resources using the generated base address (replacing the old `create_local_server`). |
| `yaml_set` / `yaml_get` | Read and write YAML configuration in the data directory. |
| `getPath` / `getLocale` / `get_displays_info` | Common paths, the system UI language, and multi-display information. |
| `clear_data_directory` | Clears this application's data directory (requires a confirmation token). |
| `jadeview_version` | Reads JadeView's own version string. |
| `register_url_scheme`, etc. | Custom protocols and file associations. |
| `register_global_hotkey`, etc. | Global hotkeys (you receive the `global-hotkey` event). |
| Tray-related | See [System Tray](/en-US/docs/api/tray-api). |

---

## Core Structs

### Window options struct (`WebViewWindowOptions`)

**Purpose**: Describes **what the first screen looks like, whether it can be resized, and where it appears on screen**. The field order must match the **struct declaration in `JadeView.h`**; underfilling, overfilling, or type misalignment will cause **silent memory misreads**.

| Field | What it controls |
|------|----------|
| `title` | The text on the window's title bar. |
| `width` / `height` | The initial width and height (pixels). |
| `resizable` | Whether the user can drag the edges with the mouse to resize it. |
| `frame_style` | Whether to have a system frame + title bar, only a frame without a title bar, completely borderless, or borderless + a built-in title bar button overlay (`normal` / `no-titlebar` / `borderless` / `title-overlay`). `title-overlay` provides a frame + no title bar + built-in title bar buttons in the top-right corner (each button is 45 pixels wide, and the height defaults to 32 pixels), with no need to implement the window control button functionality yourself (supported on both Windows and Linux, Linux since v2.3.0-beta.6). |
| `transparent` | Whether to have a transparent background (depends on WebView and system capabilities). |
| `background_color` | The window background color string (such as hexadecimal with a `#`). |
| `always_on_top` | Whether it always stays in front. |
| `theme` | Light / dark / follow the system (`Light`, `Dark`, `System`). |
| `maximized` | Whether to be maximized when opened. |
| `maximizable` / `minimizable` | Whether the maximize/minimize buttons on the title bar are allowed to take effect. |
| `x` / `y` | The coordinates of the window's top-left corner; **both being -1 means letting the system center it for you**. |
| `min_*` / `max_*` | The allowed minimum and maximum sizes; `0` usually means no limit. |
| `fullscreen` | Whether to be fullscreen when opened. |
| `focus` | Whether to grab keyboard focus after opening. |
| `hide_window` | When non-0, create it first but do not show it (suitable for loading first and then `show`). |
| `use_page_icon` | Whether to use the web page favicon as the initial window icon. |
| `content_protection` | Whether to enable anti-recording/anti-screenshot protection. |
| `auto_save_state` | When non-`0`: records the window's **last valid physical top-left coordinates** by **`window_id`** in `window_state.yaml` under the **data directory**; the next time you create it with the same `window_id`, if that position still falls within the work area of some screen, the **position is restored** (**the width, height, and whether it is maximized still follow this creation's parameters**). It is debounced and flushed to disk about **450ms** after the move stops; it is also saved once more on close. |

:::warning
2.0 has removed the old fields `remove_titlebar`, `borderless`, `no_center`, etc.; you must use `frame_style` and `x/y=-1` for centering, otherwise the struct will not line up and will **silently misalign**.
:::

### Web page behavior struct (`WebViewSettings`)

**Purpose**: Controls **the behavior of the web page inside WebView** (autoplay, right-click, UA, etc.). Passing `NULL` means using all defaults.

| Field | What it controls |
|------|----------|
| `autoplay` | Whether media can autoplay. |
| `background_throttling` | Whether to lower the timer/animation frequency to save resources when the window is in the background. |
| `disable_right_click` | Whether to disable the web page context menu. |
| `ua` | A custom User-Agent. |
| `preload_js` | A piece of JS to inject before the page loads. |
| `allow_fullscreen` | Whether the fullscreen API in the web page is allowed. |
| `postmessage_whitelist` | The whitelist for **whether the page's `postMessage` is forwarded to the main process**; the value is **a single UTF-8 string** (usually close to the page's `origin`, such as `https://example.com`). When matching, the library passes if: `event.origin` is **equal to** that string, or the **`origin` has that string as a suffix**. If the pointer is **`NULL`/unset**: under the current implementation, **no source is allowed through** (i.e., `postmessage-received` is not received). **Built-in static pages loaded via `set_protocol_service_path`** will **skip the whitelist** in the implementation and can always receive. |
| `autofill` | Whether to enable account/password autofill. `0` = disabled, `1` = enabled. *(Added in 2.2)* |
| `general_autofill_enabled` | Whether to enable general form autofill (name/address/phone, etc.). `0` = disabled, `1` = enabled. *(Added in 2.2)* |
| `incognito` | Whether to run in incognito/private browsing mode. `0` = normal mode, `1` = incognito mode. Page rendering becomes slower when enabled. *(Added in 2.2)* |
| `disable_clipboard` | Whether to disable clipboard read/write permissions. `0` = allowed, `1` = disabled. *(Added in 2.2)* |
| `proxy_url` | The proxy URL, supporting HTTP and SOCKS5 proxies (such as `"http://127.0.0.1:7890"` or `"socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"`). `NULL` means no proxy is used. *(Added in 2.2)* |
| `focused` | Whether WebView automatically gains focus initially. `0` = does not gain focus, `1` = automatically focuses (default `1`). *(Added in 2.2)* |

---

The system integration APIs (`get_cursor_position`, `clipboard_read_text`, `clipboard_write_text`, `jade_print_dialog`, `jade_get_printer_list`) have been moved to the separate document [System Integration API](/en-US/docs/api/system-api).
